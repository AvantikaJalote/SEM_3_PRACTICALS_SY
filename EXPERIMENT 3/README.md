### Concept to be implemented: New and delete operators (dynamic memory allocation), Inline functions and Function with default arguments

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 1:
In the “old days” measurements used to be expresses in yards, feet and inches (12 inches = 1 foot, 3 feet = 1 yard). Show how to convert from inches into yards, feet and inches. Write a program to demonstrate the use of new and delete operators to declare the variable in this statement.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 2:
Write a function to calculate average marks of the class of one subject, declare an array to read marks of the students using new operator and delete after use. Display result in main function.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 3:
Write a program to calculate total volume of different measure (shapes) such as cube, sphere, cylinder and cone. Write separate functions as inline functions for each shape and return their volume to main for total calculation. Display total volume in main function.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 4:
Course coordinator wants to prepare the list of students for his class by inputting data such as Name, Roll Number, Division and Program. He only input Name and Roll Number through INPUT function; other data is common for all the students. So, INPUT function will accept default arguments for constant values that need to initialize to student’s attributes. Display the data for 3 students. Write a main function to implement function with default arguments.
