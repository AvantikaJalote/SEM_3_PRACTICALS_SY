### Concept to be implemented: Function overloading, Call by reference with an array.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 1: 
 
User would like to add two numbers of different types such as short, int, float, double, long double, long int. System accepts the numbers and depending on its type appropriate function would be invoked. Display the result of addition.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 2: 

Write a program to calculate total “Volume” of different measure (Shapes) such as cube, sphere, cylinder and cone. Write separate functions for each shape and return their volume to main for total calculation. Display total volume in main function.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 3:

Enter the marks of the students and display highest and lowest marks of the class. Apply ‘Max’ and ‘Min’ functions to find out the maximum value and minimum value from the list of elements. Pass an array by reference to ‘Max’ and ‘Min’ function from main. Display maximum and minimum values in main function.
