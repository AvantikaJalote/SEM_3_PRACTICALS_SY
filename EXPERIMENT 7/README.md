### Concept to be implemented: Operator Overloading with friend function

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 1:
Write a program to calculate the results of a student by combining internal and external marks out of 100. Write two separate classes as “Internal1” and “External1” with following data members common to both the classes. (out of 50 marks for each class)
•	Marks of Math
•	Marks of OPP
•	Marks of SE
•	Marks of DS
Use constructor to input the marks for each class. Define binary operator overloading using friend function to calculate the final result by combining internal and external marks. 
Perform following tasks:  
1.	Print the total marks subject wise.   
2.	Print the result depending on marks of individual subjects (Marks < 50 - fail)
3.	Calculate total marks 
4.	Print percentage if student pass

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 2:
MCGM want to prepare the list of doctor area wise to assign the duty to take care of patients. In order to prepare the list, computer operator enter the name of doctor and area. Finally, this list is sorted area wise, system uses operator overloading concept (function) to compare the area. 
Implement comparison (<) operator function to compare the area alphabetically. 
Use this function in the main to sort the list alphabetically on area.
Print the sorted list in the main function.
